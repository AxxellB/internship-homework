# internship-homework
This repo will be used for uploading homeworks during the internship.
Files will be separated into folders representing each week and exercise. For example: W1E1 means Week 1, Exercise 1.

## W1E1
The code for the W1E1 should be run from terminal in order to be able to pass options to the application from the command line.
To pass options we use --option_name=option_value after typing the command which executes the script in this case php run_script.php.
An example of how to run the calculator app with options would look like this: php calculator.php --type=arithmetic --operator=minus --param1=20 --param2=3
