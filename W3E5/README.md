# W3E5

W3E5 consists of building the front-end part(a couple of pages of it) of a crypto currency website.
The aim of this exercise to build a modern, good looking and easy to use web platform.

## Usage

The entry point of this application is the index.php file but even though this is a mostly html file, it still consists
of some php needed for the rendering of
some elements which is why it is strongly recommended that you start a simple server using the command
`php -S 0.0.0.0:80` which would start a server on localhost, port 80. Simply open the link which you get in your
terminal after you execute the command and your
application should start immediately in a web browser of your choice(usually your default one).
Note: There are no dependencies that need to be install in order for the application to work!

### Technologies

The technologies being used for the building of this web platform are: HTML, CSS, PHP, Bootstrap
