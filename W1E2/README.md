Upon starting the script you will be prompted to type your name, make sure you do not leave it blank.
Once you have typed your name the game will begin. You will be provided with a series of questions and the potential answers will be found below the question.
If you know the answer you must type it correctly in the terminal. If you answer was correct you will see a "Correct!" message in your terminal and you will be asked the next question.
